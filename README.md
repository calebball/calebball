### `ohhai`

I'm Caleb, a software engineer based in Australia.

I call myself an aspirational polyglot; at the moment I'm working in Python and Rust.
I mostly deal with number crunching code, but I dig into much more than that including web development, developer tooling, infrastructure and drivers.
At the moment I'm trying to explore interpreters/compilers and formal verification.
